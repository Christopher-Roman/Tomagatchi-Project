This game was inspired by the 90's Tomagatchi handheld devices. I am a big fan of Venom from the Spider-Man comic books and decided that he would be a fun character to utilize.

Currently, Venom has three forms within the Tomagatchi. He transforms at different times based on his age. The player must keep his hunger, sleepiness, and boredom below 10 or he will die.

In future builds:
I want people to be able to choose a character
I need to work on separate animations for the different actions the player uses
I need those animations to transition more smoothly
I am working on the lights going off when he sleeps
I want to integrate more movement on the screen when the player is idle
