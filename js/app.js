// I am going to need to create a class for the tomagatchi
	//the class will need to display the following:
	//name
	//age
	//hunger 
	//sleepiness
	//boredom

// The class will also need several methods
	//A method that increases the age every few minutes
	//sleepiness method that has the sleepiness increase every few minutes
	//hunger method that has the hunger icnrease every few minutes
	//boredom method that inceases the bordom every few minutes
	//death method that kills the tomigatchi if any of the stats reach 10

// It will also need a method that will morph it into something after it reaches a certain age
	// what ability do I want it to have?

// I will also need to build a method that allows it to have a baby once it reaches a certain age
	// I can make 
	// I can have it lay an egg and make the egg hatch after a certain amount of time
	// I can add a method to the baby class that gives it a random ability once it hatches

// I will need to create buttons that decrease the various stats based on what they are
	// A button to feed the pet that will decrease hunger
	// A button to play with the pet that will decrease boredom
	// A button put the pet to bed that will decrease sleepiness
